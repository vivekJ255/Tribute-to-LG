                        <u><h2 style="text-align: center;">WHY LG LEFT THE MOBILE MARKET ?</h2></u>
                        <br>
                        LG announced its exit from the smartphone market earlier this week. It wasn't a sudden move as the mobile division of the South Korean company had 
                        been making losses for some time. The departure of LG from the smartphone market was a sad moment for at least
                        some loyal customers. On this week's episode of Orbital, the Gadgets 360 podcast, the discussion revolves
                        around the exit of LG from the smartphone market. Counterpoint associate director Tarun Pathak joins host
                        Akhil Arora and Gadgets 360 reviews editor Jamshed Avari to talk about what made LG exit the market and
                        why we saw it coming.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            During its time, LG managed to bring some very exciting phones to the market.
                            These include the LG G Flex, which had a self healing back, LG G8X ThinQ with a detachable dual screen, 
                            and the recently launched LG Wing with a rotating display.
                            The company also showed off its rollable smartphone concept at CES 2021 that wowed even
                            its critics, and the media. However, those innovations didn't help the 
                            company gain against the likes of Apple and Samsung. LG also failed to make use 
                            of webOS, or its partnership with Intel that was announced in 2016 to embrace 10-nanometre ARM chips.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The reason why LG decides to quit is they faced Loss over several
                            billion dollars in Mobile department. The are many reasons for loss
                            <br>
                            1. Pricing( they are not pricing competitively)
                            <br>
                            2. Innovation ( am not saying they are bad at innovation , they are
                            actually super excellent but they are innovating something for
                            each and every mobile and not considering the innovation of
                            previous Mobile, so developers also can't work well for that
                            single Mobile)
                            <br>
                            3. Updates ( updates are usually slow from there track records)
                            <br>
                            4. Naming ( There is a big confusion in naming smartphone
                            nowadays and LG is first of all , they will just name their
                            smartphone with unusual order and very rare name which people
                            can easily forget).
